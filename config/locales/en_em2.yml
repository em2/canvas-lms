      page_title: Class Groups
      group_explanation: Groups are a good place to collaborate on projects or to figure out schedules for study sessions and the like. Every group gets a calendar, a wiki, discussions, and a little bit of space to store files. Groups can collaborate on documents, or even schedule web conferences. It's really like a mini-class where you can work with a smaller number of students on a more focused project.
      course_groups: Class Groups
      groups_disabled: Student-organized groups have been disabled for this class, so you'll have to be content with the groups the teacher makes for you.
      options: 
        open_to_course_members: Class members are free to join
        course_member_can_request_access: Class members can request to join
    context_manage_groups: 
      self_signup_help_message: |-
        You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
        Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
        students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
        do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
        class section.
        
        Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
        your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
        sign-ups.
      actions: 
        add_students: Add Students to the Class
      account_group_explanation: Account-level student groups are a good way to group students without being tied to a specific class. Every student group gets their own calendar, discussion board and collaboration tools so they can organize themselves and work together more effectively.

        hashtags: |-
          Hashtags are special phrases that let people consistently mention the same idea (like a class) on web sites like Twitter.  For example, the message "I like #instructure" is using the hashtag "instructure".
          
          Hashtags should consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores (no spaces).  The hashtag should be unique, easily recognizable, and short.  Short hashtags are better since sites like Twitter limit the number of letters per message.

        modules: |-
          You can organize your class into **modules or sections**, where each section contains a related set of files, assignments, pages, etc.  If you want, you can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites that need to be completed before each module is unlocked.
          
          This layout is probably best for classes that aren't based on a specific schedule like a term or semester.
        communication_stream: The **communication stream** lets participants see the most recent conversations, notifications, and interactions for this class.  It's very similar to the dashboard page users see when they first log in, but only shows content for this specific class.
        confirm_unenroll: Are you sure you want to unenroll in this class? You will no longer be able to see the class roster or communicate directly with the teachers, and you will no longer see class events in your stream and as notifications.
        joining_a_course: Once you join a class you will see it show up in your class list. You'll be able to participate in graded portions of the class and communicate directly with the teachers and other students. You'll also see conversations and events from this class show up in your stream and as notifications.
        custom_page: You can **design your own class home page** and include whatever links, images or rich media you like.
        syllabus: The **syllabus view** lets you write up a description of class expectations or introduce the class with links, images, etc. and then also shows a calendar view of all assignments and class events.
        assignments: This view shows the **list of assignments** for this class, with upcoming and recent assignments at the top.

            Great, so you've got a class...  Now what?  Well, before you go publishing it to the world, you may want to check and make sure you've got the basics laid out.  Work through the list on the left to ensure that your class is ready to use.

            Publishing will send out email invitations to all the class users so they can sign up and start participating.
          not_registered: This class is claimed and ready, but you'll need to finish the registration process before you can publish the class. You should have received an email from Canvas with a link to finish the process. Be sure to check your spam box.
        tas: You may want to assign some TAs to help you with the class. TAs can grade student submissions, help moderate the discussions and even update due dates and assignment details for you.
        import: If you've been using another class management system, you probably have stuff in there that you're going to want moved over to Canvas. We can walk you through the process of easily migrating your content into Canvas.
        navigation: By default all links are enabled for a class.  Students won't see links to sections that don't have content.  For example, if you haven't created any assessments, they won't see the assessments link.  You can sort and explicitly disable these links if there are areas of the class you don't want your students accessing.
        calendar: Here's a great chance to get to know the calendar -- and add any non-assignment events you might have to the class. Don't worry, we'll help you through it.

          Class modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
          You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review assessment.

      quiz_ip_filters_help_message: |-
        Assessment IP filters are a way to limit access to assessments to computers in a specified IP range.
        
        Specify a set of IP address filters that teachers can use to protect access to assessments.  Filters can be a comma-separated list of addresses, or an address followed by a mask ("192.168.217.1/24" or "192.168.217.1/255.255.255.0")."

      teacherless_add_student_notice_just_email: If you'd like, you can invite your fellow classmates to also use this class. That way they won't have to set up the grading policies all over again, and we'll also give you a place to share files and collaborate. Just paste in a list of email addresses below to invite others to join.
      teacher_add_student_notice_just_email: "*Next, you'll want to add students to your class.* You can add them one by one or as a whole list. Paste in just email addresses (bob@example.com) or names with addresses #(\"Jones, Bob M.\" <bob@example.com>)# separated by commas or on separate lines."

      unpublished_notice: Don't worry, this class will stay visible to just you until you publish it. When you publish, your class will become active and students will be notified that it's has been created and they are enrolled. You can publish at any time from the class's main page.

Assignments are organized into groups (assessments, papers, etc.), and each group can be weighted to count as a percentage of the final score.  We've added a default group above to get you started.  You can add assignments to it by clicking the plus icon, or use the links to the right to create your own groups."
      grade_groups_notice: Nicely done. Next you'll want to define the assignments for your class. Most classes base grades either on straight points, or points according to types (50% of your grade is from tests, 20% is from papers, etc.). In Canvas you add assignments, assessments, or whatever into groups and optionally weight those groups. Build your Canvas class to match the grading scheme of your actual class, and we'll take care of computing your final grade for you.
      skip_assignments_notice: Not ready to create your assignments? Feel free to skip this step, you can always come back to it later after your class is set up.
